Hints for a successful PR:
1. It is recommended that before you submit a PR to IOTA, to open an issue first and assign yourself.
This way you may get inputs and discover parallel PRs to the one you want to submit.
2. In case of a big PR, consider breaking it up to smaller PRs. This will help getting it merged in an incremental process
3. It will be helpful if you make additional comments on the code via github PR review to explain the chooices you made
