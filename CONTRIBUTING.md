## How to contribute to IRI

#### **How should a Pull Request look like**?
Before creating a PR make sure you have read the entire contributing guideline. Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution by following the template. It is best to discuss your changes in an issue before creating the PR. A PR should address a **specific concern**. If it addresses more than one concern it **should be split**. Small PRs get merged in faster. Very large PRs are difficult to review and test. This makes them less likely to be merged.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in IRI**, and instead, please contact us via [security@iota.org](mailto:security@iota.org).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri/issues). You can also look up related issues by a label. For example, if your issue is database-related, filter based on the `C-DB` label and look for related issues. If it's API related, use `C-API` and so on. `C` stands for component. Make sure you skim through the labels to find your category. 

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, and as much relevant information as possible. Make sure you follow our new issue template. The first part of the issue template is dedicated to reporting bugs, delete the second part. Steps to reproduce are particularly important. Add any relevant log output and screenshots. The easier it will be to reproduce your issue, the more likely it's getting fixed. 

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* [New issues](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri/issues/new) should be used for reporting issues. If you already wrote a patch for an issue that you or someone else reported, make sure you link it to the open issue. You can do this by mentioning the issue number in the comment or description on the PR, for example `#123` to link issue "123". 

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change as a [new issues](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri/issues/new). Use the second part of the issue template, dedicated to new feature requests and delete the first part. If you plan on implementing the change yourself, start writing the code and submit a PR. Note that the fact that the feature is "code ready" doesn't mean it will get merged. It is advisable to gather feedback for the change first. You are encouraged to start and drive a discussion on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/fNGZXvh). The IRI team also monitors the repo and will provide feedback where relevant. 


#### **Do you have questions about the functioning of IRI nodes, the network or anything IOTA related?**

* Use our [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/fNGZXvh) to join the discussion and ask questions.

#### **Do you want to contribute to the IRI documentation?**

The IOTA documentation is based in the [docs](https://github.com/iotaledger/docs) repo. You are welcome to contribute. Make sure you follow the instructions on adding new docs. 

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
