1.8.5

Protocol-Change:
    Added bundle validity rules - check that bundles confirm only tails and 2 bundles at most (#1786)
    Check validity rules on tip-sel and check-consistency only (#1802)


1.8.4

Hotfix: Ensure proper creation of solid entrypoints (#1702)

1.8.3

There is an edge case where IRI didn't account for a transaction that was shared between two distinct bundles.
Once it marked it as "counted" in one bundle, it was ignored for the next bundle. This lead to a corrupt ledger state.

Hotfix: Gyros - take transaction reattachments into account (#1699)

1.8.2

Change: The alpha value is now 0 by default, streamlining the tip selection process which will reduce memory and cpu load. This is done by skipping cumulative weight calculations. (Issue #1567)
