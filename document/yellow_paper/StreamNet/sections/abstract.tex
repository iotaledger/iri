\begin{abstract}
To achieve high throughtput in the POW based blockchain systems, a series of methods has been proposed, 
and DAG is one of the most active and promising field.
We designed and implemented the StreamNet aiming to engineer 
a scalable and endurable DAG system. 
When attaching a new block in the DAG, only two tips are selected. 
One is the `parent' tip whose definition is the same as in Conflux \cite{li2018scaling},
another is using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique by which the definition is the same as IOTA \cite{popov2016tangle}.
We infer a pivotal chain along the path of each epoch in the graph,
and a total order of the graph could be calculated without a centralized authority.
By leveraging the graph streaming property,
high transaction validation speed will be achieved even if the DAG is growing.
We implemented our system based on IOTA's reference code (IRI), 
and ran comprehensive experiments over different size of clusters of multiple network topologies. 
Despite the shortcoming of the IRI's network part, our implementation scales with the growth of data size.
