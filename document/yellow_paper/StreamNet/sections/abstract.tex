To achieve high throughtput in the $POW$ based blockchain systems, a series of methods has been proposed, and $DAG$ is one of the most active and promising field.
Considering major issues in the existing $DAG$ systems such as centralization,
double-spending, sybil attacks, and slow transaction validation speed etc. 
We designed and implemented the StreamNet system aiming to tackle with these problems. 
By leveraging the Katz centrality computation, 
we infer a pivotal chain along the path of each epoch in the graph,
and each block in the pivotal chain will have the highest Katz centrality score (as oppsed to the $GHOST$ rule).
When attaching a new block in the $DAG$, two tips are selected. 
One is the `parent' tip whose definition is the same as in $Conflux$ \cite{li2018scaling},
another is using Markov Chain Monte Carlo ($MCMC$) technique by which the definition is the same as $IOTA$ \cite{popov2016tangle},
with Katz centrality as the weight determinator. 
In this way, a total order of the graph could be infered without a centralized authority and high transaction validation speed will be achieved.
In addtion, with comprehensive integration of information such as transaction (vertices), 
transaction approval information (edges), and network structure (such as community structure) 
a tip filtering algorithm can be optionally configured to detect and avoid double spend / sybil attacks.
