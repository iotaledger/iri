Feature: Test Bootstrapping With LS
  A test to determine whether or not nodes can bootstrap and sync correctly from Local Snapshot Files and DB's. One
  permanode will be started containing all the relevant files/folders for a full sync upon start. Two more nodes will
  be started, connected to this node and one another: One will have only a DB and snapshot file, while the other will
  have only the snapshot meta and state file, along with the spent addresses DB and the snapshot file. All three nodes
  should sync with one another. And a snapshot should be taken on the node started with just a DB.
  [NodeA: Permanode, NodeB: Just DB, NodeC: Just LS Files]

  Scenario: PermaNode is synced
    Check that the permanode has been started correctly and is synced.

    #First make sure nodes are neighbored
    Given "nodeA" and "nodeB" are neighbors
    And "nodeA" and "nodeC" are neighbors

    #Default for test is to issue 10322
    When milestone 10322 is issued on "nodeA"
    And we wait "60" second/seconds
    Then "nodeA" is synced up to milestone 10322


  Scenario: DB node is synced, and files contain expected values
    Check that the node started with just a DB is synced correctly, and that the proper addresses and hashes have been
    stored correctly.

    #First make sure nodes are neighbored
    Given "nodeB" and "nodeA" are neighbors
    And "nodeB" and "nodeC" are neighbors

    # Default for test is to issue 10323
    When milestone 10323 is issued on "nodeA"
    #Give the node time to finish syncing properly, then make sure that the node is synced to the latest milestone.
    And we wait "60" second/seconds
    Then "nodeB" is synced up to milestone 10323
    And A local snapshot was taken on "nodeB" at index 10220

    When reading the local snapshot state on "nodeB" returns with:
      |keys                       |values                   |type             |
      |address                    |LS_TEST_STATE_ADDRESSES  |staticValue      |

    And reading the local snapshot metadata on "nodeB" returns with:
      |keys                       |values                   |type             |
      |hashes                     |LS_TEST_MILESTONE_HASHES |staticValue      |


  Scenario: LS File node is synced
    Check that the node started with just LS Files is synced correctly.

    #First make sure nodes are neighbored
    Given "nodeC" and "nodeA" are neighbors
    And "nodeC" and "nodeB" are neighbors

    #Default for test is to issue 10324
    When milestone 10324 is issued on "nodeA"
    #Give the node time to finish syncing properly, then make sure that the node is synced to the latest milestone.
    And we wait "180" second/seconds
    Then "nodeC" is synced up to milestone 10324


  Scenario: Check DB for milestone hashes
    Give the db-less node some time to receive the latest milestones from the permanode, then check if the milestones
    are present in the new node.

    #First make sure nodes are neighbored
    Given "nodeC" and "nodeA" are neighbors
     #Default for test is to issue 10325
    When milestone 10325 is issued on "nodeA"
    And we wait "60" second/seconds

    Then "checkConsistency" is called on "nodeC" with:
      |keys                       |values                   |type             |
      |tails                      |LS_TEST_MILESTONE_HASHES |staticValue      |

    And the response for "checkConsistency" should return with:
      |keys                       |values                   |type             |
      |state                      |True                     |bool             |


  Scenario: Old transactions are pruned
    Takes a node with a large db and transaction pruning enabled, and checks to make sure that the transactions below
    the pruning depth are no longer present.

    Given "checkConsistency" is called on "nodeD" with:
      |keys                       |values                   |type             |
      |tails                      |LS_PRUNED_TRANSACTIONS   |staticValue      |

    Then the response for "checkConsistency" should return null
